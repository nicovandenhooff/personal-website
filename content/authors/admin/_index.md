Currently, I am a graduate student in the Master's of Data Science ("MDS") program at the University of British Columbia ("UBC"), with an expected graduation date of June 30, 2022.  My studies are focused on supervised learning, statistical inference, collaborative software development, and data visualization.  My cumulative GPA to date is 97.6\%, which demonstrates my strong aptitude for these topics.  I am passionate about machine learning and deep learning and look forward to being a life-long learning in these spaces.

Prior to UBC, I worked for six years in finance.  Most recently, I worked at KPMG LLP Vancouver as a Senior Accountant/Consultant, where I led the financial statement audits of financial institutions, including one of the firm's largest credit union clients. I also obtained my [Chartered Professional Accountant](https://www.cpacanada.ca/) designation and placed on the Canadian National Honour roll on the 2017 final entrance exam, which was awarded to the top 1% of writers in Canada.

I have a strong foundation for machine learning that includes undergrad courses in calculus, linear algebra, and programming (including data structures and algorithms), for which I attained at least 92% in each course.  In terms of programming, I am well versed in Python, R, SQL, and have academic exposure to Java.  I also have a deep understanding of all of the common Python libraries used for data science, including NumPy, pandas, sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and seaborn.

In my free time I enjoy long distance running, golf, and whisky tasting.  To date, I have completed 3 marathons, and over 20 half marathons.  I am registered for the Vancouver Marathon in May 2022 and I have a personal goal to complete it in 3 hours and 30 minutes.  Finally, I am also the owner of the Instagram account [@whiskyaficionado](https://www.instagram.com/whiskyaficionado/?hl=en) where I share my thoughts about whisky with 10k+ followers.
