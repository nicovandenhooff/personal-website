I am a graduate student in the [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) ("MDS") program at the University of British Columbia ("UBC"), with an expected graduation date of June 30, 2022.  My studies are focused on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, statistical inference (frequentist and Bayesian), software development, and data visualization.  My cumulative first term GPA is 97.6\%, which demonstrates my strong aptitude for these topics.  Machine learning and deep learning are my passion, and I especially enjoy working with image data and Convolutional Neural Networks.

Prior to UBC, I worked in the finance industry for six years.  Most recently, I worked at [KPMG LLP](https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html) Vancouver as a Senior Accountant/Consultant.  At KPMG I led the financial statement audits of financial institutions, including one of the firm's largest banking clients who had $23 billion in assets under management. I also am a [Chartered Professional Accountant](https://www.cpacanada.ca/) ("CPA"), and I placed on the Canadian National Honour roll in 2017 when I wrote the CPA final entrance exam (awarded to the top 1% of writers across Canada).

In addition to MDS, I have a strong foundation for machine learning that includes undergrad courses in calculus, linear algebra, and programming (including data structures and algorithms), for which I attained at least 92% in each course.  I am well versed in Python, R, SQL, and have academic exposure to Java.  I also have a deep understanding of all of the common Python libraries used for data science, including NumPy, pandas, sci-kit learn, PyTorch, and Matplotlib to name a few.

In my free time I enjoy long distance running, golf, listening to music, and whisky tasting.  I have completed three marathons and look forward to participating in the 2022 Vancouver Marathon in May.  Finally, I am also the owner of the Instagram account [@whiskyaficionado](https://www.instagram.com/whiskyaficionado/?hl=en) where I share my thoughts about whisky with 10k+ followers.
