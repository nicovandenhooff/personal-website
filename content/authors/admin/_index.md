I'm currently completing the [Master of Data Science Program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) (“MDS”) at the University of British Columbia, with an expected graduation date of June 30, 2022.  

Prior to UBC, I worked in finance for six years, including three years at KPMG (a "big 4" accounting firm) as a Senior Accountant, and obtained my [Chartered Professional Accountant](https://www.cpacanada.ca/) designation.  I placed on the Canadian National Honour roll on the 2017 CPA final entrance exam, which was awarded to the top 1% of writers in Canada.

I have a passion for data science and machine learning and I have the ultimate goal of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.  Before I started the MDS program at UBC, I focused on building a strong foundation for machine learning, and in my completed several university level courses in math (linear algebra, calculus), programming (incl. data structures & algorithms), and probability and statistics.  I’m very excited to be pivoting my career towards this space and look forward to what the future holds.

In my free time I enjoy long distance running, golf, and whisky tasting.  To date, I’ve completed 3 marathons, and over 20 half marathons.  I’m also the owner of the Instagram account [@whiskyaficionado](https://www.instagram.com/whiskyaficionado/?hl=en) where I share my thoughts about whisky with 10k+ followers.
