I am currently a graduate student in the [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) ("MDS") program at the University of British Columbia ("UBC"), with an expected graduation date of June 30, 2022. At UBC my studies have been focused on supervised and unsupervised learning, software development, statistics, and data visualization. I'm currently work on my final capstone project in partnership with TRIUMF and CERN.  My team and I are working with data collected by CERN in Switzerland as part of their [NA62 project](https://home.cern/science/experiments/na62).  We are developing a deep learning model for the purpose of classifying sub-atomic particle decays.

Prior to UBC, I worked in the finance industry for six years.  Most recently, I worked at [KPMG LLP](https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html) Vancouver as a Senior Accountant/Consultant.  At KPMG I gained invaluable experience in project management, as I was in charge of leading engagements with large banking, wealth management, and real estate clients. I am also proud to have obtained the highest performance ranking of top 5% of my peer group for each the years that I was employed at KPMG. I am also a [Chartered Professional Accountant](https://www.cpacanada.ca/) ("CPA"), and I placed on the Canadian National Honour roll in 2017 when I wrote the CPA final entrance exam (awarded to the top 1% of writers across Canada).

In my free time I enjoy long distance running, golf, listening to music, and whisky tasting.  I have completed three marathons and several half marathons.  Finally, I am also the owner of the Instagram account [@whiskyaficionado](https://www.instagram.com/whiskyaficionado/?hl=en) where I share my thoughts about whisky with 10k+ followers.
