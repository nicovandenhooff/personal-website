Currently, I am a Machine Learning Scientist at Patriot One Technologies.  I work within a cross-functional engineering team in developing the next generation of threat detection systems and technologies.  Right now, I'm working on the machine learning aspects of our [SmartGateway](https://patriot1tech.com/patscan/multi-sensor/) product.  I'm passionate about all things machine learning and deep learning related.  Prior to working with Patriot One, I completed my Masters degree in Data Science at the University of British Columbia, which included completing a capstone project with TRIUMF, Canada's largest particle accelerator centre.  As part of the capstone project my team and I trained and tuned state-of-the-art graph neural network models for the purposes of classifying sub-atomic particles.  In my spare time I am an avid runner and golfer, I enjoy music, and I love tasting wine and whisky.
