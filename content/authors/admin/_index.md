Currently, I am a graduate student in the [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) program at the University of British Columbia ("UBC"). Right now I am working on my final capstone project in partnership with TRIUMF and CERN.  My team and I are working with data collected by CERN in Switzerland as part of their [NA62 research project](https://home.cern/science/experiments/na62).  We are developing a deep learning model to be used in classifying the decays of sub-atomic particles.

In July 2022 I will be joining the Multi-Sensor Gateway team at [Patriot One Technologies](https://patriot1tech.com/) as a Junior Machine Learning Scientist.  I am beyond excited to be joining such a talented team, and I am truly looking forward to using machine learning to develop the next generation of covert threat detection systems that will help create a safer world.

I worked in finance for six years prior to completing my Master's degree.  Most recently, I worked at [KPMG LLP](https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html) as a Senior Accountant/Consultant.  At KPMG I gained invaluable experience in leadership and project management, as I was in charge of client engagements with large banking, wealth management, and real estate corporations. I am also a [Chartered Professional Accountant](https://www.cpacanada.ca/) ("CPA"), and I placed on the Canadian National Honour roll in 2017 when I wrote the CPA final entrance exam (awarded to the top 1% of writers across Canada).

In my free time I enjoy long distance running, golf, listening to music, and whisky tasting.  I have completed three marathons and several half marathons.  Finally, I am also the owner of the Instagram account [@whiskyaficionado](https://www.instagram.com/whiskyaficionado/?hl=en) where I share my thoughts about whisky with 10k+ followers.
